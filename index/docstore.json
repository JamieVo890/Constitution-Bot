CONSTITUTIONiiiOverview\nby the Australian Government Solicitor\nThe Australian Constitution has properly been described as \u2018the birth certificate of a nation\u2019. It also provides \nthe basic rules for the government of Australia. Indeed, the Constitution is the fundamental law of Australia \nbinding everybody including the Commonwealth Parliament and the Parliament of each State. Accordingly, \neven an Act passed by a Parliament is invalid if it is contrary to the\u00a0Constitution.\nBackground to the Constitution\nThe Constitution was drafted at a series of conventions held during the 1890s and attended by \nrepresentatives of the colonies. Before the Constitution came into effect, its terms were approved, with one \nsmall exception, by the people of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, \nand Tasmania. \nThe Australian Constitution was then passed as part of a British Act of Parliament in 1900, and took effect \non 1\u00a0January 1901. A British Act was necessary because before 1901 Australia was a collection of six self-\ngoverning British colonies and ultimate power over those colonies rested with the British Parliament. In reality, \nhowever, the Constitution is a document which was conceived by Australians, drafted by Australians and \napproved by Australians.\nSince that time, Australia has become an independent nation, and the character of the Constitution as the \nfundamental law of Australia is now seen as resting predominantly, not on its status as an Act of the British \nParliament, which no longer has any power over Australia, but on the Australian people\u2019s decision to approve \nand be bound by the terms of the\u00a0Constitution.\nWhat has been judicially described as \u2018the sovereignty of the Australian people\u2019 is also recognised by section \n128 which provides that any change to the Constitution must be approved by the people of Australia.\nThe Constitution itself is contained in clause 9 of the British Act. The first eight clauses of the British Act \nare commonly referred to as the \u2018covering clauses\u2019. They contain mainly introductory, explanatory and \nconsequential provisions. For\u00a0example, covering clause 2 provides that references to \u2018the Queen\u2019 (meaning \nQueen Victoria, who was British sovereign at the time the British Act was enacted) shall include references \nto Queen Victoria\u2019s heirs and successors. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022, \nreferences in the Constitution to \u2018the Queen\u2019 now include King Charles\u00a0III.\nCreation of the Commonwealth of Australia\nOn the commencement of the British Act on 1 January 1901, the Commonwealth came into being and the six \ncolonies became the six States of Australia (covering clauses 4 and 6).\nThe Federal Structure\nThe Constitution establishes a federal system of government. It\u00a0is for this reason that the establishment of the \nCommonwealth in 1901 is often referred to as \u2018federation\u2019. Under a federal system, powers are distributed \nbetween a central government and regional governments. In\u00a0Australia, that distribution is between the \nCommonwealth and the\u00a0six\u00a0States. (The\u00a0relationship between the Commonwealth\u00a0and\u00a0the Territories is \ndiscussed below.)\nSeparation of Powers\nChapters I, II, and III of the Constitution confer the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the \nCommonwealth on three different bodies which are established by the Constitution \u2013 the Parliament (Chapter \nI), the Executive Government (Chapter II), and the Judicature (Chapter III).

Only the Parliament can pass Acts, but these Acts often confer on the \nExecutive Government the power to make regulations, rules and by-laws in relation to matters relevant to the \nparticular\u00a0Acts.\nFor example, the Parliament may enact in the Customs Act that no person may bring a \u2018prohibited import\u2019 into \nAustralia and then leave it to the Executive to specify in the Customs Regulations what is a \u2018prohibited import\u2019. \nThis delegation of legislative power is not as extreme as it may appear, however, as both Houses of Parliament \nusually retain the power to \u2018disallow\u2019 (that is, reject), within a specified time, any regulation which has been \nmade by the Executive.\nThe distinction between the Parliament and the Executive Government is further blurred by the fact that the \nPrime Minister and the other Government Ministers (who form part of the Executive) must be members of \nParliament. This\u00a0reflects the principle of responsible government (discussed below) under which Government \nMinisters must be members of, and accountable to, the Parliament. \nBy contrast, the separation between the Judicature on the one hand and the Parliament and the Executive \nGovernment on the other is strict. Only a court may exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth, so that, \nfor example, the question whether a person has contravened a law of the Parliament (for example, by bringing \na \u2018prohibited import\u2019 into the country) can only be conclusively determined by a court.\nThe Crown and Responsible Government\nAs well as being a federation, Australia is a constitutional monarchy. Under this system of government, as the \nterm suggests, the head of State of a country is a monarch whose functions are regulated by a constitution. \nThe concept of \u2018the Crown\u2019 pervades the Constitution. For example, the Queen is part of the Parliament \n(section 1), and is empowered to appoint the Governor-General as her representative (section\u00a02). The \nexecutive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as \nher representative (section 61).\nDespite the terms of the Constitution, the Queen does not play a day-to-day role in the Commonwealth \nGovernment. Those few functions which the Queen does perform (for example, appointing the Governor-\nGeneral) are done in accordance with advice from the Prime Minister.\nThe Governor-General performs a large number of functions. However, apart from exceptional circumstances \n(discussed below), the Governor-General acts in accordance with the advice of Commonwealth Ministers. \nThe reason for this is the principle of \u2018responsible government\u2019 which is basic to our system of government \nand which underlies our Constitution. Under this principle, the Crown (represented by the Governor-General) \nacts on the advice of its Ministers who are in turn members of, and responsible to, the Parliament. It is for this \nreason that section 64 of the Constitution requires Ministers to be, or become, members of\u00a0Parliament.\nThere is a small number of matters (probably only four) in relation to which the Governor-General is not \nrequired to act in accordance with Ministerial advice. The powers which the Governor-General has in this \nrespect are known as \u2018reserve powers\u2019. The two most important reserve powers are the powers to appoint and \nto dismiss a Prime Minister. In\u00a0exercising a reserve power, the Governor-General ordinarily acts in accordance \nwith established and generally accepted rules of practice known as \u2018conventions\u2019. For\u00a0example, when \nappointing a Prime Minister under section 64 of the Constitution, the Governor-General must, by convention, \nappoint the parliamentary leader of the party or coalition of parties which has a majority of seats in the House \nof\u00a0Representatives.\nThere can be circumstances, however, where there is no generally agreed convention to control the exercise \nof the Governor-General\u2019s reserve powers. Such a situation arose in 1975 when the Governor-General, Sir \nJohn Kerr, dismissed the Prime Minister, Mr E.G. Whitlam, after the Senate \u2013 controlled by Opposition parties \n\u2013 blocked the passage of the Supply Bill in an attempt to deprive the Whitlam Government of the funds \nneeded to govern.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4379, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "040c3774-b689-4e68-a247-de5a4e375887": {"__data__": {"id_": "040c3774-b689-4e68-a247-de5a4e375887", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "v", "file_name": "2023_Australian_Constitution.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\JayVo\\Documents\\GitHub\\Constitution-Bot\\data\\2023_Australian_Constitution.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 687646, "creation_date": "2024-06-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "62308b50-1d2d-4539-945e-c3d60946753a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "v", "file_name": "2023_Australian_Constitution.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\JayVo\\Documents\\GitHub\\Constitution-Bot\\data\\2023_Australian_Constitution.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 687646, "creation_date": "2024-06-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-25"}, "hash": "51b008112cbc8d13212f13204d46547e8fa000646a408fa6c82ef4cab3d6b962", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "AUSTRALIA\u2019S CONSTITUTIONvSome people argue that Sir John acted properly in dismissing Mr\u00a0Whitlam as it was consistent with a \n\u2018convention\u2019 that a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply should either seek a general election or \nbe dismissed. Others contend that the dismissal of Mr Whitlam breached the convention that a person \nwho retains majority support of the House of Representatives, as Mr Whitlam did, is entitled to remain \nPrime\u00a0Minister.\nRepresentative Government\nAnother fundamental principle which underlies the Constitution is that of \u2018representative government\u2019 \u2013 \nthat is, government by representatives of the people who are chosen by the people. Consistently with this \nprinciple, sections 7 and 28 of the Constitution require regular elections for the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate, and sections 7 and 24 require members of the Commonwealth Parliament to be directly chosen \nby the people.\nCommonwealth Parliament\nThe Constitution established the Commonwealth Parliament comprising the Queen, a House of \nRepresentatives and a Senate (sections 1\u201360). The people of each of the six States elect the same number \nof senators (currently 12), regardless of their State\u2019s population, and the people of the Northern Territory \nand the Australian Capital Territory are each currently represented by two senators. This gives a total of 76 \nsenators. In the House of Representatives the number of seats from each State (and Territory) depends on \nthe population (although each State is guaranteed at least five seats). The current number of members of the \nHouse of Representatives is 151. \nBefore a proposed law (commonly referred to as a Bill) becomes an Act of Parliament it must be passed by \nboth the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Bill is then presented to the Governor-General who \nassents to it in the Queen\u2019s name (section 58). A Bill becomes an Act of Parliament when it receives this \nassent. Nearly all Bills which subsequently become Acts of Parliament are proposed by the Government \n\u2013 that is, the parliamentary party or coalition of parties which holds a majority of seats in the House of \nRepresentatives.\nSubject to the few exceptions referred to in section 53 in relation to the initiation and amendment of Bills \nwhich appropriate revenue or impose taxation, the Senate has equal power with the House of Representatives \nin respect of all Bills. Often the Government does not have a majority of seats in the Senate. Accordingly, \ndisputes may arise between the two Houses as to whether a Bill should be passed in its proposed form. These \ndisputes are nearly always resolved by the two\u00a0Houses.\nSection 57 prescribes the procedure for resolving any irreconcilable disagreement between the two Houses. \nThat procedure essentially involves the dissolution of both Houses of Parliament by the Governor-General \n(that\u00a0is, a \u2018double dissolution\u2019), the holding of an election for both the House of Representatives and the \nSenate, and then, if\u00a0necessary, the convening of a joint sitting of the two Houses following the election to \ndetermine whether the proposed law or laws which led to the dissolution should\u00a0be\u00a0passed.\nCommonwealth Legislative Powers\nThe Constitution confers the power to make laws on the Commonwealth Parliament. However, the power of the \nCommonwealth Parliament to make laws is limited to particular subjects. Most of these subjects are listed in \nsections 51 and 52. They include defence; external affairs; interstate and international trade; taxation; foreign, \ntrading and financial corporations; marriage and divorce; immigration; bankruptcy; and interstate industrial \nconciliation and arbitration.\nThis list of powers given to the Commonwealth Parliament does not expressly refer to a number of important \nsubjects including education, the environment, criminal law, and roads \u2013 but this does not mean that \nthose subjects are wholly outside the Parliament\u2019s powers. For example, even though the Commonwealth \nParliament has no specific power in relation to the environment, it can, under its external affairs power, \nprohibit the construction of a dam by a State if that is necessary to give effect to an international agreement \non the environment. The legislative powers of the Commonwealth Parliament can also be expanded by the \nParliaments of the States referring matters to the Commonwealth Parliament under section 51(xxxvii).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4411, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b4f1267-1a62-48d5-8f89-87d8976b2421": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b4f1267-1a62-48d5-8f89-87d8976b2421", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "vi", "file_name": "2023_Australian_Constitution.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\JayVo\\Documents\\GitHub\\Constitution-Bot\\data\\2023_Australian_Constitution.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 687646, "creation_date": "2024-06-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "283ea727-6587-4b3b-8063-009630c2a271", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "vi", "file_name": "2023_Australian_Constitution.pdf", "file_path": "c:\\Users\\JayVo\\Documents\\GitHub\\Constitution-Bot\\data\\2023_Australian_Constitution.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 687646, "creation_date": "2024-06-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-25"}, "hash": "4ec8be29c2117a4e70d2242a0143be0e5ed9e12ed6e86045c463e6f4d5560ec7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "AUSTRALIA\u2019S CONSTITUTIONviThe States and their Legislative Powers\nUnder the federal system created by the Australian Constitution, the six former colonies became the six \nStates of Australia. Before federation, each of the six colonies had its own constitution. These constitutions \nregulated, among other things, the Legislature, the Executive Government, and the Judiciary of the States. \nThe Australian Constitution expressly guarantees the continuing existence of the States and preserves each of \ntheir constitutions. However, the States are bound by the Australian Constitution, and the constitutions of the \nStates must be read subject to the Australian Constitution (sections 106 and 107).\nUnder the constitutions of each of the States, a State Parliament can make laws on any subject of relevance \nto that particular State. Subject to a few exceptions, the Australian Constitution does not confine the \nmatters about which the States may make laws. (The most important exceptions are that the States cannot \nimpose duties of customs and excise (section 90) and cannot raise defence forces without the consent of \nthe Commonwealth Parliament (section 114).) Accordingly, the State Parliaments can pass laws on a wider \nrange of subjects than the Commonwealth Parliament, and for this reason important areas such as education, \ncriminal law, and roads are regulated primarily by laws of the States rather than by laws of the Commonwealth \nParliament.\nThe Relationship between Commonwealth and State Powers\nAlthough the State Parliaments can pass laws on a wider range of subjects than the Commonwealth \nParliament, the Commonwealth is generally regarded as the more powerful partner in the federation. One of \nthe principal reasons for this is section 109 of the Constitution which provides that if a valid Commonwealth \nlaw is inconsistent with a law of a State Parliament, the Commonwealth law operates and the State law is \ninvalid to the extent of the inconsistency.\nAccordingly, the Commonwealth can, within the subject matters conferred on it by the Constitution, \noverride State laws. As a result, many subjects of Commonwealth power are regulated almost entirely by \nCommonwealth law, for example, bankruptcy, marriage and divorce, and immigration.\nFurther, the States have traditionally not raised sufficient revenue to perform all their functions. During the \nSecond World War, Commonwealth legislation effectively excluded the States from imposing income tax, \nand since then, various political and economic considerations have resulted in income tax being imposed \nsolely by the Commonwealth. Also,\u00a0the States are unable to impose taxes of customs and excise (section 90). \nConsequently, the States have received grants of financial assistance from the Commonwealth. Many of these \ngrants are made without conditions.\nSection 96 of the Constitution, however, allows the Commonwealth to make conditional grants of money to \nthe States for any purpose. This power to impose conditions on how the money is spent by the States allows \nthe Commonwealth to influence the way things are done in areas over which it has no direct power to pass \nlaws. For example, the Commonwealth has exerted significant control over universities in this way even though \nit has no specific power in relation to education.\nThe Executive Government of the Commonwealth\nA literal reading of the Constitution does not give much information about how the Executive Government of \nthe Commonwealth functions. For example, the terms of Chapter\u00a0II (sections 61\u201370) give the impression that \nthe Governor-General has sweeping powers in relation to the Commonwealth Government. Section 61 says \nthat the executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-\nGeneral, while section 68 provides that the command of the defence forces is vested in the Governor-General.\nThe Governor-General, however, exercises his or her powers in accordance with the principle of responsible \ngovernment (discussed earlier). Consequently, in all but exceptional circumstances, the Governor-General \nacts in accordance with advice from the Ministers of the Government. The appointment of Ministers and \nthe creation of Departments of State to administer the Government of the Commonwealth are referred to in \nsection 64. Section 64 also provides that Ministers must be, or become, members of Parliament.\nIn practice Ministers are also members of the parliamentary party or coalition of parties which holds a \nmajority of seats in the House of Representatives. Ministers may either be senators or members of the House \nof Representatives, although established constitutional practice dictates that the Prime Minister must be a \nmember of the House of Representatives rather than a senator.

However, only \ncurrent Ministers take part in Executive Council business, and usually only two or three Ministers attend \nmeetings of the Council with the Governor-General. Unlike the Cabinet, the Executive Council is not a \ndeliberative body. Its principal functions are to receive advice and approve the signing of formal documents \nsuch as regulations and statutory appointments.\nFederal Judicature\nChapter III of the Constitution (sections 71\u201380) provides for the establishment of the High Court of Australia. \nOne of the High Court\u2019s principal functions is to decide disputes about the meaning of the Constitution. For \nexample, it is the High Court which ultimately determines whether an Act passed by the Commonwealth \nParliament is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth. The power which the High Court has to \ninterpret the Constitution means that it is a very important body. The High Court is also the final court of \nappeal within Australia in all other types of cases, even those dealing with purely State matters such as \nconvictions under State criminal\u00a0laws.\nChapter III also gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to create other federal courts (for example, the \nFederal Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia), and to vest the judicial power \nof the Commonwealth in such courts and in courts of the States. \u2018The judicial power of the Commonwealth\u2019 is \njudicial power to determine one or more of the classes of dispute set out in sections 75 and 76.\nAn Australian \u2018Common Market\u2019\nChapter IV of the Constitution (sections 81\u2013105A) contains provisions regulating, among other things, trade \nand commerce throughout Australia. The desire to have a single trade area throughout Australia was one of \nthe main reasons for the movement by the Australian people towards federation. To achieve this, Australia \nneeded both uniform customs duties and the abolition of protectionist burdens on interstate\u00a0trade.\nThe Constitution achieves the first of these objectives by requiring the Commonwealth Parliament to impose \nuniform customs duties (section 88) and by prohibiting the State Parliaments from imposing customs duties \n(section 90). It\u00a0achieves the second objective primarily by providing in section\u00a092 that trade and commerce \nbetween the States shall be \u2018absolutely free\u2019.\nSection 92, in effect, prohibits action by either the Commonwealth or a State which discriminates against \ninterstate trade or commerce and which has the purpose or effect of protecting intrastate trade or commerce \nof a State against competition from other States. For example, section 92 would be contravened if the New \nSouth Wales Parliament, in an attempt to make NSW milk more price-competitive, imposed a special tax on \nall milk sold in NSW which had been produced in\u00a0Victoria. (Section 92 also protects freedom of movement \nacross State borders; in effect it prohibits action that discriminates against interstate intercourse and which is \nnot reasonably necessary to achieve a legitimate object.)\nChapter IV also regulates other aspects of finance and trade. Two of the more important provisions \nare section\u00a081, which provides that all money raised or received by the Executive Government of the \nCommonwealth is to form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, and section 83, which provides that no money \nmay be expended by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth without the authority of\u00a0Parliament.\nNew States\nThe Constitution makes provision for the establishment and admission of new States (sections 121 and 124). \nNo new States have been established or admitted since federation.

In relation to these \nTerritories (of which there are currently 10), the Commonwealth Parliament can make laws on any subject \u2013 \nthat is, it does not share its law-making power with the State Parliaments as it does in relation to the States. \nThe Commonwealth Parliament has conferred a large measure of self-government on the people of two of the \nTerritories, namely the Australian Capital Territory and the\u00a0Northern\u00a0Territory.\nRights\nThe Constitution has no Bill of Rights, such as that found in the United States Constitution, which prevents \na legislature from passing laws that infringe basic human rights, such as freedom of speech. Some \nexpress protections, however, are given by the Constitution against legislative or executive action by the \nCommonwealth, but not by the States. Examples are section 51(xxxi) (acquisition of property must be \u2018on just \nterms\u2019), section 80 (trial by jury is required in relation to some criminal offences), and section 116 (a right \nexists to exercise any\u00a0religion).\nSection 117 prohibits the Parliament of a State from discriminating against non-residents of that State. It \nprovides, in effect, that a resident in, say, Victoria shall not be subject to any discrimination or disability in, \nsay, Queensland unless the person would also be subject to that disability or discrimination as a resident of \nQueensland. (The question whether section 117 limits the lawmaking power of the Commonwealth Parliament \nhas not yet been conclusively resolved by the High Court.)\nThe High Court has also recognised some implied restrictions on legislative power derived from the \nfundamental system of government established by the Constitution. For\u00a0example, because of the separation \nof powers effected by the Constitution, only a court may exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. \nAccordingly, a law of the Commonwealth Parliament cannot provide for criminal conviction by any body other \nthan a court.\nAnother example of how implications from the terms or structure of the Constitution can restrict legislative \npower was provided in 1992 when the High Court declared invalid a Commonwealth law which attempted to \nrestrict the broadcasting of political advertising. The Court decided that the restrictions imposed by that law \nwere inconsistent with a necessary aspect of representative government entrenched by the Constitution \u2013 \nspecifically, the right to freedom of communication on political matters.\nAmending the Constitution\nThe Constitution provides a mechanism by which it can be altered, called a referendum. Before there can \nbe any change to the Constitution, a majority of electors must vote in favour of the change. In addition, there \nmust be a majority vote in a majority of States, that is, in four out of the six States. (Further, a proposed \namendment which would diminish the representation of a State in the Commonwealth Parliament or which \nwould alter the territorial limits of a State must be approved by a majority of electors in that State.)
