      "AUSTRALIA’S CONSTITUTIONivDespite the structure of the Constitution there is no strict demarcation between the legislative and executive \n",
      "powers of the Commonwealth. Only the Parliament can pass Acts, but these Acts often confer on the \n",
      "Executive Government the power to make regulations, rules and by-laws in relation to matters relevant to the \n",
      "particular Acts.\n",
      "For example, the Parliament may enact in the Customs Act that no person may bring a ‘prohibited import’ into \n",
      "Australia and then leave it to the Executive to specify in the Customs Regulations what is a ‘prohibited import’. \n",
      "This delegation of legislative power is not as extreme as it may appear, however, as both Houses of Parliament \n",
      "usually retain the power to ‘disallow’ (that is, reject), within a specified time, any regulation which has been \n",
      "made by the Executive.\n",
      "The distinction between the Parliament and the Executive Government is further blurred by the fact that the \n",
      "Prime Minister and the other Government Ministers (who form part of the Executive) must be members of \n",
      "Parliament. This reflects the principle of responsible government (discussed below) under which Government \n",
      "Ministers must be members of, and accountable to, the Parliament. \n",
      "By contrast, the separation between the Judicature on the one hand and the Parliament and the Executive \n",
      "Government on the other is strict. Only a court may exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth, so that, \n",
      "for example, the question whether a person has contravened a law of the Parliament (for example, by bringing \n",
      "a ‘prohibited import’ into the country) can only be conclusively determined by a court.\n",
      "The Crown and Responsible Government\n",
      "As well as being a federation, Australia is a constitutional monarchy. Under this system of government, as the \n",
      "term suggests, the head of State of a country is a monarch whose functions are regulated by a constitution. \n",
      "The concept of ‘the Crown’ pervades the Constitution. For example, the Queen is part of the Parliament \n",
      "(section 1), and is empowered to appoint the Governor-General as her representative (section 2). The \n",
      "executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as \n",
      "her representative (section 61).\n",
      "Despite the terms of the Constitution, the Queen does not play a day-to-day role in the Commonwealth \n",
      "Government. Those few functions which the Queen does perform (for example, appointing the Governor-\n",
      "General) are done in accordance with advice from the Prime Minister.\n",
      "The Governor-General performs a large number of functions. However, apart from exceptional circumstances \n",
      "(discussed below), the Governor-General acts in accordance with the advice of Commonwealth Ministers. \n",
      "The reason for this is the principle of ‘responsible government’ which is basic to our system of government \n",
      "and which underlies our Constitution. Under this principle, the Crown (represented by the Governor-General) \n",
      "acts on the advice of its Ministers who are in turn members of, and responsible to, the Parliament. It is for this \n",
      "reason that section 64 of the Constitution requires Ministers to be, or become, members of Parliament.\n",
      "There is a small number of matters (probably only four) in relation to which the Governor-General is not \n",
      "required to act in accordance with Ministerial advice. The powers which the Governor-General has in this \n",
      "respect are known as ‘reserve powers’. The two most important reserve powers are the powers to appoint and \n",
      "to dismiss a Prime Minister. In exercising a reserve power, the Governor-General ordinarily acts in accordance \n",
      "with established and generally accepted rules of practice known as ‘conventions’. For example, when \n",
      "appointing a Prime Minister under section 64 of the Constitution, the Governor-General must, by convention, \n",
      "appoint the parliamentary leader of the party or coalition of parties which has a majority of seats in the House \n",
      "of Representatives.\n",
      "There can be circumstances, however, where there is no generally agreed convention to control the exercise \n",
      "of the Governor-General’s reserve powers. Such a situation arose in 1975 when the Governor-General, Sir \n",
      "John Kerr, dismissed the Prime Minister, Mr E.G. Whitlam, after the Senate – controlled by Opposition parties \n",
      "– blocked the passage of the Supply Bill in an attempt to deprive the Whitlam Government of the funds \n",
      "needed to govern.\n",
      "AUSTRALIA’S CONSTITUTIONvSome people argue that Sir John acted properly in dismissing Mr Whitlam as it was consistent with a \n",
      "‘convention’ that a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply should either seek a general election or \n",
      "be dismissed. Others contend that the dismissal of Mr Whitlam breached the convention that a person \n",
      "who retains majority support of the House of Representatives, as Mr Whitlam did, is entitled to remain \n",
      "Prime Minister.\n",
      "Representative Government\n",
      "Another fundamental principle which underlies the Constitution is that of ‘representative government’ – \n",
      "that is, government by representatives of the people who are chosen by the people. Consistently with this \n",
      "principle, sections 7 and 28 of the Constitution require regular elections for the House of Representatives and \n",
      "the Senate, and sections 7 and 24 require members of the Commonwealth Parliament to be directly chosen \n",
      "by the people.\n",
      "Commonwealth Parliament\n",
      "The Constitution established the Commonwealth Parliament comprising the Queen, a House of \n",
      "Representatives and a Senate (sections 1–60). The people of each of the six States elect the same number \n",
      "of senators (currently 12), regardless of their State’s population, and the people of the Northern Territory \n",
      "and the Australian Capital Territory are each currently represented by two senators. This gives a total of 76 \n",
      "senators. In the House of Representatives the number of seats from each State (and Territory) depends on \n",
      "the population (although each State is guaranteed at least five seats). The current number of members of the \n",
      "House of Representatives is 151. \n",
      "Before a proposed law (commonly referred to as a Bill) becomes an Act of Parliament it must be passed by \n",
      "both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Bill is then presented to the Governor-General who \n",
      "assents to it in the Queen’s name (section 58). A Bill becomes an Act of Parliament when it receives this \n",
      "assent. Nearly all Bills which subsequently become Acts of Parliament are proposed by the Government \n",
      "– that is, the parliamentary party or coalition of parties which holds a majority of seats in the House of \n",
      "Representatives.\n",
      "Subject to the few exceptions referred to in section 53 in relation to the initiation and amendment of Bills \n",
      "which appropriate revenue or impose taxation, the Senate has equal power with the House of Representatives \n",
      "in respect of all Bills. Often the Government does not have a majority of seats in the Senate. Accordingly, \n",
      "disputes may arise between the two Houses as to whether a Bill should be passed in its proposed form. These \n",
      "disputes are nearly always resolved by the two Houses.\n",
      "Section 57 prescribes the procedure for resolving any irreconcilable disagreement between the two Houses. \n",
      "That procedure essentially involves the dissolution of both Houses of Parliament by the Governor-General \n",
      "(that is, a ‘double dissolution’), the holding of an election for both the House of Representatives and the \n",
      "Senate, and then, if necessary, the convening of a joint sitting of the two Houses following the election to \n",
      "determine whether the proposed law or laws which led to the dissolution should be passed.\n",
      "Commonwealth Legislative Powers\n",
      "The Constitution confers the power to make laws on the Commonwealth Parliament. However, the power of the \n",
      "Commonwealth Parliament to make laws is limited to particular subjects. Most of these subjects are listed in \n",
      "sections 51 and 52. They include defence; external affairs; interstate and international trade; taxation; foreign, \n",
      "trading and financial corporations; marriage and divorce; immigration; bankruptcy; and interstate industrial \n",
      "conciliation and arbitration.\n",
      "This list of powers given to the Commonwealth Parliament does not expressly refer to a number of important \n",
      "subjects including education, the environment, criminal law, and roads – but this does not mean that \n",
      "those subjects are wholly outside the Parliament’s powers. For example, even though the Commonwealth \n",
      "Parliament has no specific power in relation to the environment, it can, under its external affairs power, \n",
      "prohibit the construction of a dam by a State if that is necessary to give effect to an international agreement \n",
      "on the environment. The legislative powers of the Commonwealth Parliament can also be expanded by the \n",
